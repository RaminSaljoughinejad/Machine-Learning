    Summery of the session:
        * Linear Regression:
            y = ax + b
                y is dependent on ax+b
                a is the slop of our line (how fast it is going up or down)
                    if we have 2 points on our line we can determine the slop using the following equation:
                        y2 - y1 / x2 - x1 -> a
                x shows where we are on x axis
                b is our y intercept
                    means -> where we start our line at

        * WE ARE GOING TO create a Linear model using Linear Regression
            create our best line in multi dimensional space
